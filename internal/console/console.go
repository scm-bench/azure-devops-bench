// Package console renders what the tool puts on a terminal: tables, wrapped
// prose, colour, and the tagged lines it writes about itself.
//
// It exists because several separate things write to the terminal — scan's
// report, diff's report, the scan trace — and they have to look like one
// program. The table renderer, the tag vocabulary and the colours were defined
// separately before, which is exactly the arrangement that drifts: nothing
// fails when one side gains a tag or changes a border, the output just quietly
// stops lining up.
//
// Two shapes live here, and they do not overlap. Stdout is tables and prose:
// that is the report, and it is the thing a person reads. Stderr is tagged
// lines: that is the tool talking about itself, read interleaved with whatever
// else is on the terminal, where a bracketed word at the start of a line is
// what separates one program's voice from another's.

// A Tag is the bracketed word in column one of a line on stderr.
